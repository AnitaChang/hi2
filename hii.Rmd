# Introduction
### Caculating with R
```{r}
5+49
3-8
3*5
31%%7
31%/%7
```

###  vector

c()function is used to collect things together into a vector
```{r}
c(0,7,8)
```
create sequences
```{r}
numbers5to20<-5:20
c(numbers5to20,7)
```

###  Extracting elements from vectors

display the 8th element of mess
```{r}
mess<-c(numbers5to20,7)
mess[8]
```

find the third through eleventh elements
```{r}
mess[-(3:11)]
```

###  Vector arithmetic

multiply all element
```{r}
x<-c(0,7,8)
x*3
```


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

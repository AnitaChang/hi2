## Introduction to R language
### Caculating with R 
```{r}
5+49
3-8
3*5
31%%7
31%/%7
```

###  vector

c()function is used to collect things together into a vector
```{r}
c(0,7,8)
```
create sequences
```{r}
numbers5to20<-5:20
c(numbers5to20,7)
```

###  Extracting elements from vectors

display the 8th element of mess
```{r}
mess<-c(numbers5to20,7)
mess[8]
```

find the third through eleventh elements
```{r}
mess[-(3:11)]
```

###  Vector arithmetic

multiply all element
```{r}
x<-c(0,7,8)
x*3
```

```{r}
y<--x-5
```

take the third power of element
```{r}
x^3
```

work *element by element* 
```{r}
y^x
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Simple patterned vectors

#### Patterned vectors can also be produced using **seq()** function as wel as **rep()** function. <br> Repeated patterns are obtained using ** rep()**.

```{r}
rep(seq(2,20,by=2),2)
```
repeat the patter1,3 times and 4,twice
```{r}
rep(c(1,4),c(3,2))
```
repeat each value twice
```{r}
rep(seq(2,20,2),rep(2,10))
```

### Character vectors
#### Scalers and vectors can be made up of strings of characters instead of numbers.All element of a vector must be of **the same type**.
This appended some new elements to colors.
```{r}
colors<-c("red","yellow","blue")
more.colors<-c(colors,"green","magenta","cyan")
more.colors
```
#### **paste()** This is building up strings by connection.
```{r}
paste(colors,"flowers")
```
The sep() controls what goes between the components being pasted together.
```{r}
paste("several",colors,"s",sep="")
```
**collpase()** to paste() allows all the components of the resulting vector to be collapsed into a single string.
```{r}
paste("I like",colors,collapse = ",")
```
### Matrics and arrays
#### To arrange values into a matrix , we use the **matrix()** function.
```{r}
m<-matrix(1:6,nrow=2,ncol=3)
m
```
see the element of the first row,second column
```{r}
m[1,2]
```
#### A more general way to store data is in an array.Arrays have multiple indices,and are created using the array function.
```{r}
a<-array(1:24,c(3,4,2))
a
```
### Data frames
#### **frame()** function is to construct data frames from vectors.
```{r}
colors<-c("red","yellow","blue")
numbers<-c(1,2,3)
colors.and.numbers<-data.frame(colors,numbers,more.numbers=c(4,5,6))
colors.and.numbers
```

### Built in graphics functions
Two basiic plot are the histogram and the scatterplot.


```{r,fig.width=5,fig.height=5,fig.align="center",fig.show="asis"}
x<-c(12,15,13,20,14,16,10,10,8,15)
hist(x)
x<-seq(1,10)
y<-x^2-10*x
plot(x,y)

```

## Programming statistical graphics
### High level plots
The **beside=TRUE** arguement causes the values in each column to be plotted side by side.  **legend=TRUE** causes the legend in the top right to be added.
```{r,fig.align="center"}
barplot(VADeaths,beside=TRUE,legend=TRUE,ylim = c(0,90),ylab = "Deaths per 1000",main="Death rates in Virginia")
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
